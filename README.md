# Capstone Project

## Description
This is the final project I will be making for my bloc courses & it is meant to be the best display of my knowledge & proficiency in coding yet. This project will be an app that sorts, organizes & displays the user's personal collection of pictures. It will store metadata in a local database that will allow the user to *very* easily sort & search through their pictures however they want to. In addition, it will feature a pleasing & robust UI while incorporating external APIs (see User Experiences section) to enhance functionality.

## User Experiences
- Users should be able to sign up, login & see their homepage.
- Users should be able to see & browse their pictures laid out in a pleasing format.
- Users should be able to add a picture from local storage into their collection.
- Users should be able to add/remove tags on images.
- Users should be able to sort & search by tags and other metadata.
- Users should be able to add a picture from the internet into their collection. Said image should be downloaded locally & any existing metadata, if properly attached, should populate the database automatically.
- Users should be able to export their personal database for backup/transfer to a new device.
- App should monitor local files & alert the user if any errors occur between local files & database.
- **Potential Bonus Feature**: Post to social media without leaving the app.
There are a few other features I'm mulling over, but unless I truly want to put the effort in to turn this into a magnum opus, I'll not add them (They'll be added to this readme if I see fit to at least think about including them).
